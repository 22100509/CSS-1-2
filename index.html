          <p id="magicArticle">
            Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool
            trick is called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical
            reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s
            version of neon lights!
          </p>
          <h3 id="howWorksHead">Here's how it works:</h3>

          <ol id="pinkList">
            <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
            <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li>
              Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold
              light.”
            </li>
          </ol>
